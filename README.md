# My Portfolio Page 

This website was created as my online CV and portfolio. It is written using JavaScript ES6, with React.JS framework. I also used the React Router in this project, especially to navigate through two languages.

## Responsiveness

The page is suitable for being launched both on desktop and mobile devices. The website uses CSS Flex in order to dynamically sort images in the gallery and on main site. It also uses CSS Grid for proper alignment of navbar and contact buttons, which changes dynamically according to screen's size. All of the links are opened in new tabs and contact buttons are active.

## Visuals

The webpage was designed as a business card, it tries to be as static as possible in its shape. In the "Skills" tab I created some animations and CSS filters to make the icons look interesting.

## Frameworks

The webpage is built using React v.18, it also makes use of React Router. I have also used AOS for fluent animations on show-up of items.
